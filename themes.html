					<li data-theme="b">Phoniness</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One word that constantly fills the pages of The Catcher in the Rye is 'phony', as Holden loves using it to describe just about everything he despises.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden views nearly everyone in the adult world, as well as most of his classmates as being phony.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He views the adults around him as being extremely superficial, only interested in keeping their image in society up even if it means completely forgoing their morals.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">What makes Holden's contempt for these people worse is that as he is getting older and closer to graduating high school, he realizes that he soon will be thrust into adult society and must live and socialize with all those he views phony.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden's views seem a little outlandish, and do not seem to excuse why he has given up in school and on life, however they are not without some truth.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden's family is very wealthy, living in an upscale New York apartment, and sending their children to expensive prep schools, which explains why he may believe he is surrounded by phonies.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is Holden's struggle with phoniness that leads to his breakdown, and is something that he must battle with in order to maintain a successful role in society as he grows up.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Coming of age</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is clear that the novel tells a coming of age story, however the protagonist would not be an obvious choice for this type of story as Holden has seemingly no desire to become an adult and accept the changes that come with it.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">During the novel Holden makes it clear that he fears growing up, and the best example of this is his visits to the Natural History Museum where he struggles with accepting that each time he visits he has changed dramatically while all the exhibits remain the same.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It also appears that Holden fears growing up because he does not understand all the aspects of what it means to be an adult, particularly sex.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden makes it more difficult for himself by refusing to accept the unknown of adulthood, and instead convince himself that all adults are phonies, therefore making the transition even harder as he believes that if he allows himself to grow up, he too will become a phony.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Being that it is a coming of age story, Holden does come around to accepting his fate with the help of his sister and an old teacher.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He does not fully embrace it, but in the end he realizes that he must attempt to make the transition into adult hood by finishing his schooling.</li>
