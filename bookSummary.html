					<li data-theme="d">The Catcher in the Rye follows a teenage boy's struggle to understand himself following his 
					expulsion from high school. In the novel, Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from Pencey Prep for failing nearly all his classes. 
					Holden has bounced from school to school never really finding his place, and his latest expulsion seems to put him on edge. The novel 
					follows the next few days after his expulsion as he roams his home city of New York and contemplates his future. It is quite clear to 
					the reader that Holden has a very volatile personality which stems from his contempt for pretty much every person he meets, except 
					for a select few, as he views most of society as 'phonies'. In the novel Holden's character struggles to find any satisfaction in his 
					life and at one point resolves to run away and move out west. His grand plan is however put in check by his younger sister who Holden
					loves dearly. Holden's sister Phoebe convinces him to give up his plan, and after a final emotional and physical collapse Holden is 
					places in a rest home to recover. In the end Holden resolves to once again give society a chance as well as attempt to get through
					schooling at a new school.</li>
