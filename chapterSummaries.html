					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 1</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The novel opens as the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, begins relaying what has brought him to therapy.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden however shies away from his early life, choosing to focus on more recent occurrences.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He does however bring up his brother, D.B., briefly as he explains that he sold out his writing talents for the glamour of Hollywood.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden then dives into the details of what has brought him into therapy.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden had been attending a very prestigious and well-to-do prep school known as Pencey Prep in Agerstown, Pennsylvania.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He goes on to explain that at the end of the recent fall term he was told he could not return to Pencey Prep, as he had failed all of his classes except for English.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is clear though that his failure does not stem from a lack of intelligence, instead a lack of motivation seems the reason.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden describes the last Saturday at Pencey before he was set to leave for Christmas vacation.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">On Pencey's campus a large hill overlooks the school's football field, this particular Saturday the school's team is playing an important game against the bitter rivals from Saxon Hall.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden has no interest in football, and would never have stopped by to see the game if it weren't for an embarrassing mistake he made earlier in the day.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden, the manager of the fencing team, had been in charge of all of the the gear for a meet in New York City earlier in the day, however he managed to lose it all on the subway forcing the team to return to school.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While overlooking the field Holden contemplates his time spent at Pencey Prep, and though most of his experiences were negative, he does seem to have some fond memories.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Deciding to take advantage of his time left, Holden runs across campus to the home of his favorite teacher Mr. Spencer.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Mr. Spencer was Holden's history teacher a few years back, and recently has become very ill.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Holden arrives at his home he is very winded from his habit of smoking; Mr. Spencer's wife greets him and he enters to say his goodbyes.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 2</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden seems to harbor a great respect for his former teacher, and despite his deteriorating condition, Holden is not put off.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two begin a conversation, however it swiftly turns into a lecture as Mr. Spencer is ashamed at how Holden can go through life without any care, particularly when it comes to his academics.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It is quite clear that the lecture is intended for Holden's best interests, however Holden is obviously annoyed and proceeds to cut the conversation short and leave the Spencers'</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 3</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden returns to his dorm room in Ossenburger Hall, named for a famous graduate of the school who made a vast fortune in the funeral business.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden begins to relax and read from the novel Out of Africa, however he is interrupted after a short while by a student who lives next door.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The student is referred to as Ackley, and by Holden's description; he is quite a repulsive teenager.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ackley is described as being extremely pimply, with constant halitosis (bad breath).</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Ackley is also a very nosy person and constantly invades Holden's personal space.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While in Holden's room Ackley proceeds to badger Holden with questions and irritate him to the point where Holden is near snapping when Holden's roommate Stradlater joins them.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Stradlater is a very precocious and handsome teenager who seems to have no trouble with the girls at Pencey Prep.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It is obvious that Stradlater intimidates Ackley, and he immediately leaves the room when Stradlater enters.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Stradlater announces to Holden that he has returned to shave before a date that he has that evening.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 4</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden decides to follow Stradlater to the bathroom when he goes to shave so he can have what is probably the last conversation with his roommate.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">While in the bathroom Holden inwardly compares Ackley and Stradlater.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He remarks that on the outside Ackley is a very disgusting person, and meanwhile Stradlater is very similar, however he does a good job keeping his disgusting nature hidden from those outside the dorms, particularly girls.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden refers to Stradlater as a secret slob.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">While in the bathroom Stradlater asks Holden to write an English essay for him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Stradlater explains that due to the girl he is seeing he has very little time for his studies.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The girl is Jane Gallagher, however Stradlater is unaware and refers to her as Jean.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This upsets Holden as he is well aware who the girl is and has deep feelings for her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden cannot stand the fact that someone such as Stradlater will be taking her on a date as he obviously is only interested in her sexual aspects above anything else.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually Stradlater is ready to leave, he borrows Holden's favorite hound's-tooth jacket and sets out.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Meanwhile Ackley returns to Holden's room and infuriates him even more for the next hour before dinner.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Chapter 5</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The dinner proves to be very dissatisfying, and following dinner Holden enjoys a snowball fight with some of the other boys.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He then meets up with a friend, Mal Brossard, and the two plan to head into Agerstown.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden, feeling sympathetic for Ackley, decides to bring him along.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The boys plan to see a movie, however it turns out that both Mal and Ackley have already seen the only movie playing, so instead the boys grab a burger and visit an arcade before returning to school.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Back at school Mal heads off looking for a chance to gamble with the other boys while Ackley and Holden return to Holden's room.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Ackley proceeds to pop his pimples on Holden's bed and tell of a girl he once slept with, however Holden has no interest as he does not believe the story.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Eventually Holden is able to convince Ackley to leave by explaining that he has to work on an English essay.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden then begins the essay for Stradlater with the simple instructions that it can be on anything simple in nature such as a house.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden however struggles with this topic and instead decides to write about a baseball glove his younger brother Allie used to play with.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Allie died of leukemia several years earlier, however when he was alive he would always carry around an old baseball glove on which he would write poems in green ink.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden begins to recall his memories of Allie and explains that he was the best person he knew, he was a very thoughtful and caring person, especially for his young age.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden was broken by his death and carries it to this day.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">

					<li data-theme="d">Much later that night Stradlater returns expecting his assignment to be finished.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He takes it from Holden and begins to read it, however he is displeased to find it does not particularly match the prompt.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden is enraged by Stradlater's reaction to the essay and proceeds to tear it to pieces.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Still upset, Holden decides to smoke a cigarette in the room to bother Stradlater as he pesters him with questions about the date.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Stradlater however is unwilling to share details, which further upsets Holden to the point that he attacks Stradlater.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden becomes so aggressive that Stradlater is driven to punch him, and in doing so bloodies Holden's nose.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Afraid he has gone to far, Stradlater leaves the room and Holden leaves to Ackley's room where he looks at his face.</li>
