					<li data-theme="b">Discuss the carousel scene at the end of the novel and its significance.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Watching Phoebe ride the carousel seems to act as a sort of release for Holden.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">During his time at school and the days after his expulsion it becomes evident that Holden is headed in a downward emotional spiral and is very volatile.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However when he watches his sister enjoy the carousel despite her previous protests he, for the first time in months, feels free from his contempt and ultimately happy.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It is the experience at the carousel that allows Holden to open himself to the impending changes that he faces in adulthood and ultimately accept his fate.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though by the end of the novel it is not quite clear whether Holden will be successful in his new school and his ability to accept adulthood as an institution of phoniness, he does make a significant step forward by accepting therapy and choosing to attempt attending school again.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This is all thanks to the gratification he feels while watching his sister ride the carousel.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Why does it seem Holden clings to the innocence of children?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden remarks in one of the scenes with his sister that he wants to be "the catcher in the rye" and essentially save children from getting to close to the edge of growing up.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Holden was forced to grow up extremely quickly when his younger brother Allie died.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden had been very close with his brother, spending a lot of time with him and really connecting with him.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Allie died he lost his chance at enjoying a full childhood, and Holden's childhood was essentially cut short as well.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Holden longs to hold onto any sense of his childhood as long as he can, and longs for other children to do so as well.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems this all revolves around his loss of innocence at an early age as well as the loss of his brother.</li>
